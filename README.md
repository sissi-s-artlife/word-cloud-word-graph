# Inaugural Address Analysis with Word Cloud

## Overview

This project combines text processing, word frequency analysis, and visualization to create a figure with two subplots: a bar chart and a word cloud. These visualizations display information about the top words in the inaugural address corpus.

## Project Description

### Background

I have previously undertaken various text analysis and natural language processing projects, including word frequency analysis, visualization, and text classification. However, this project marks a significant milestone as it combines all these elements into one comprehensive analysis.

### Key Features

- **Data Source:** The primary data source for this project is the NLTK library's inaugural address corpus, which contains speeches delivered by U.S. presidents during their inaugurations.

- **Text Processing:** The project includes various text processing steps such as tokenization, punctuation removal, and stop word removal to prepare the text data for analysis.

- **Word Frequency Analysis:** Word frequency analysis is performed on the processed text data to identify the most frequently occurring words in the inaugural addresses.

- **Visualization:** The project utilizes Matplotlib to create two visualizations:
  - A bar chart displaying the top N words and their frequencies in the inaugural address corpus.
  - A word cloud that visually represents the most frequent words in the corpus, with word size proportional to frequency.

### Previous Experience

While I have previously worked on projects involving text analysis, this project represents a culmination of my prior experiences. It combines the skills and techniques I have developed over time to create a comprehensive and informative analysis.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required libraries, including NLTK, Matplotlib, and WordCloud. You can use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

3. Run the `main.py` script to generate the visualizations. Ensure that you have access to the NLTK corpora and resources.

4. Explore the generated bar chart and word cloud.
